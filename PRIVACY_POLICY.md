# Hold-Em-Helper-Android-App

Welcome to the Hue-Doku Colorful Sudoku App For Android

This is an open source Android app developed by Toby Frick. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personal data, so there is no need to worry about the use of your personal data on this app or elsewhere as a result of using Hold 'Em Helper.

Best,
